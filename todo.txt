- preload images for better performance - See LoJack approach http://stackoverflow.com/questions/901677/the-definitive-best-way-to-preload-images-using-javascript-jquery
    -- to make this work better or easier, I'll rename the images using an integer, which will allow me to 
    emmetize these invisible 1x1 image divs BAM!
- Instead of on load random quote, I'll hardcode quote 0
- offsets to bring things tighter towards the center.
- breakpoints to change font-size for mobile
- Give a specific height for quote area so that button stays stationary
    Or maybe using margin collapse, text can have margin-bottom and 
    button can have margin-top
